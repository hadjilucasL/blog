Over the years I have left a trail of personal websites scattered across the web.. 
From running a webserver at home over a 56k modem (median lifespan 1-2hrs) to Angelfire and Squarespace.
Tonight I continue this tradition by spending the evening setting up github pages with Zola and Github Actions !
<!-- more -->

Mainly a CircleCI user but github actions was pretty ok to setup..

Credit where credit is due, I was primarily inspired by stumbling across [kinghajj's blog](https://kinghajj.github.io/blog/undervolting-with-secureboot-in-linux/) 
while trying to figure out how to undervolt my laptop's cpu under linux. 
Why would you want to do that ? - Probably the topic of another blog post...
The short answer is lower cpu temperatures.

Firstly, I followed the [zola deployment guide](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/#github-actions) for github pages.

Also found [this cool website](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/) to generate the build badge.
 
Theme used is the [after dark](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark)
